            they are everything...  <br>all the love , I see around in crowded market , in passing moments , you are everywhere .<br>
        I don't understand why hate sell more than love and its easy to hate , find silly reason and cool , the end  <br>
    but love.... ? love is heavy and difficult ,just heavy because I can't carry the fact that I absolutely adore your flaws and
specifically flaws  <br> its easy to sleep with that thought, but its heavy to carry the weight of it in a crowd full of fears and hate <br>
but you make the trip worth it , the weight feels like comfort <br> And i promise to carry it forever ...  </bt>
